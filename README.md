# amazon-fulfillment-centers

This is a dataset of amazon fulfillment centers created in June 2019 created for two MIT Professors. The Data was never used.

About the Amazon Dataset:
This dataset contains both the announced date of planned development, and the opening date of the fulfillment center, in addition to square footage. More details are available in the readme.docx.

What's good about this Dataset?

This dataset is unique in that it contains the announced date as well as opening date. Every dataset I have seen so far, such as mwpvl.com, only has opening date. Announced date should be useful in measuring the effects of things like speculation, as well as others.

For comparison, these nber/epi papers which primarily use mwpvl.com for their dataset have about 50 observations of opening date. Our dataset has 86 observations of opening date and announced date, in addition to 102 for announced and 148 for opening.
